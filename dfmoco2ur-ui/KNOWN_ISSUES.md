# Data display on pageLoad
PositionNames can only be loaded once the socket is initialized. 
Thus during development if you want to test that data is loaded on Starting the page, you'll 
have to go through the startup menu in order to ensure the socket is initialized and so data can be loaded.
enter "localhost:3000/startup" in the address lane as the default page during development is on /controls.
